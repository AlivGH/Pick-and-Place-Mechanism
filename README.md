This project presents the design, fabrication, and evaluation of two 3D-
printed rotational pick-and-place mechanisms developed for a mechanical
engineering design. The primary objective was to create efficient and
reliable mechanisms capable of accurately picking up objects from a
designated location and placing them at a desired position through
rotational motion. Utilizing 3D printing technology, the mechanisms were
designed to leverage its flexibility, precision, and ease of prototyping.
Designed mechanisms incorporate innovative design features, including
optimized belt and gear systems, lightweight yet robust structural
components, and precise actuation controls to achieve smooth and
accurate rotational movement. The design process involved extensive use
of CAD software (SolidWorks) for modeling. Prototypes were produced using
a high-resolution 3D printer, allowing for rapid iteration and refinement of
the designs.
The successful implementation of these mechanisms not only fulfills the
academic requirements but also provides a practical foundation for future
advancements in automation and robotics. The insights gained from this
project will contribute to the ongoing development of more sophisticated
and efficient pick-and-place systems in industrial applications.
