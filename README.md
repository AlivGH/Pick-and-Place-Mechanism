# Rotational Pick-and-Place Mechanisms

This project presents the design, fabrication, and evaluation of two 3D-printed rotational pick-and-place mechanisms developed for a mechanical engineering design course. The primary objective was to create efficient and reliable mechanisms capable of accurately picking up objects from a designated location and placing them at a desired position through rotational motion.

## Project Highlights

- **Objective:** Develop efficient and reliable rotational pick-and-place mechanisms.
- **Technology:** Utilized 3D printing for flexibility, precision, and ease of prototyping.
- **Design Features:** 
  - Optimized belt and gear systems
  - Lightweight yet robust structural components
  - Precise actuation controls for smooth and accurate rotational movement
- **Tools:** Extensive use of CAD software (SolidWorks) for modeling
- **Prototyping:** Produced using a high-resolution 3D printer for rapid iteration and refinement

The successful implementation of these mechanisms not only fulfills the academic requirements but also provides a practical foundation for future advancements in automation and robotics. The insights gained from this project will contribute to the ongoing development of more sophisticated and efficient pick-and-place systems in industrial applications.

## Key Skills

- Teamwork
- Mechanical Design
